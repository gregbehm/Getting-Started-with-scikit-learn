## Machine Learning in Python: Getting Started with scikit-learn  

### scikit-learn is a popular Python machine learning library, providing a wealth of easy-to-use tools to perform a variety of machine learning tasks. If you're new to machine learning, scikit-learn is a great way to start.  

## Example: Predicting Forest Cover from Cartographic Variables  

### This notebook demonstrates a multi-class classification problem using scikit-learn and the Forest CoverType dataset, created by the Remote Sensing and GIS Program in the Department of Forest Sciences at Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado.  

### I encourage you to download the accompanying Jupyter Notebook and experiment with it to get a feel for the overall workflow.  Try different classification algorithms to compare results.
